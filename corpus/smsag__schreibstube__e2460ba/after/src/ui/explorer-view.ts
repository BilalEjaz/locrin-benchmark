/**
 * The Schreibstube file pane.
 *
 * Obsidian's own explorer cannot be reordered or decorated by a plugin without
 * fighting its sorter, and its context menu is whatever the installed plugins
 * happened to append. This pane is the same tree drawn by us, which buys three
 * things the vault otherwise cannot have: an icon per file and per folder, a
 * sync mark on notes that mirror a source, and a pinned block at the top of
 * every folder.
 *
 * Above the tree sit two lists that are not part of it. **Bookmarks** are links
 * to somewhere the tree cannot reach — a web page, an Obsidian URI, a folder, a
 * note — read from a Markdown file a person edits by hand. **Latest** is the
 * handful of notes written most recently. Both are read-only here: the pane
 * shows them and opens them, and nothing else.
 *
 * It draws and reports. Every decision — what an icon means, what the menu
 * offers, what a pin does to the order, what a bookmark points at — lives in a
 * controller and in the services behind it. The gestures a row answers to, the
 * places a drag may land, a section's header and what the pane remembers each
 * live in a module beside this one.
